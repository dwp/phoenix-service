</h1>


<p>
  This could be because: </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>  an error was made when entering the code </li>
<li>  the employer made an error when giving you the code </li>
</ul>

<p>  Make sure you correctly entered the code given to you by the employer.  </p>

<p>  If it still does not match the company you were expecting, try going back to the employer to check they gave you the correct code.
