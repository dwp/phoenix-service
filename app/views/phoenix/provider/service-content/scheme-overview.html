  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Scheme overview   </h2>
<p>The Workplace Health Assessment Discount Scheme is new initiative by the government. It’s designed to help small and medium-sized employers assist their employees by finding and engaging with workplace-focused health providers.   </p>
<p>Employers can use this service to:  </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>get an 80% discount code to help pay for a workplace health assessment for an employee   </li>
<li>search for a private sector workplace health provider to do the assessment  </li>

      </ul>
<p>
Eligible occupational health and vocational rehabilitation providers with workplace-based experience can apply to join the scheme. If accepted, they’ll be listed in register in the service and will then be searchable by employers.   </p>


<p> 

The scheme is open to any organisation registered in England or Wales with one of the following:  </p>


<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>1 to 50 employees, and a yearly turnover of less than £10.2 million or a yearly balance sheet of less than £5.1 million </li>

  <li>51 to 250 employees, and a yearly turnover of less than £22.8 million or a yearly balance sheet of less than £11.4 million  </li>
</ul>


<p>A pilot scheme is expected to be running from Spring 2023, but this could be subject to change. You’ll be notified well before the scheme is about to open to employers.  </p>
