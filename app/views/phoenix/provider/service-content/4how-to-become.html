<p>If you think you’re eligible to join the scheme, you’ll need to email DWP any required documents listed in the ‘Eligibility’ section below. You’ll also need to include the declarations, also listed in this section.
</p>

<p>Once we receive the information you should be notified of the result of your application within 4 weeks. 
</p>
 
<p>We may also need to contact you to request more information or to clarify any information already provided. 
</p>
 
<p>If your application is successful, you will be asked to supply information about your organisation so you can be listed in the service and searched for by employers. We will also need payment details so that you can be set up as a supplier on our payment system.  </p>
