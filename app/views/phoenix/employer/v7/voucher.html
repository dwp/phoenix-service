<p>We have sent you a confirmation email containing your discount code.</p>

<p>The code will remain valid unless, or until, the occupational health assessment discount scheme ends, or changes its terms.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next </h2>


<p>You can search for an occupational health provider to do an assessment. You can do this now or come back later.
</p><p>To do this later, click the link in your confirmation email or the 'browse providers' link on the Start page of the service.</p>
<p>When you have selected a provider and agreed on an assessment, you should tell them your discount code over the phone, or email them, to claim the 80% discount.</p>


<p>You can also <a href="/phoenix/employer/v6/start-page"> get another discount code </a> for any other employees. You can use the discount scheme as many times as you like, for as many employees as you want. You can also use it again for the same employee if they need another assessment. </p>
