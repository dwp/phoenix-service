      <p>
Use this service to find a provider who can give you a discounted occupational health assessment for your employee. </p>

<p>Select a provider from the list, then use the details provided to contact them directly. The provider will talk to you about:
</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>  how complex your employee's situation is</li>
<li>  who they recommend to do the assessment - this could be a doctor, nurse or other health professional </li>
<li>  whether they need to see your employee in person - this could be to assess their workspace</li>


</ul>


<p>Based on your discussion, the provider will give you a quote for the cost of the assessment. This will be between £100 and £400. After discount, the amount you pay will be between £20 and £80.</p>
<p>The provider will invoice you. When paying, give the provider your 80% discount code and pay them the other 20%. The provider will claim the rest from the government. </p>

<p>If your employee does not attend the appointment as arranged, you will have to pay 100% of the cost. </p>
