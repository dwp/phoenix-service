<li>a long-term health condition</li>
<li>an impairment or disability  </li>
      </ul>
<p>
After the assessment, you and and your employee will get a report with advice. This can help you understand what support they need to stay in or return to work. This could include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
