  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What an occupational health assessment provides </h2>
<p>You should consider an assessment for an employee if they're finding it difficult to work because of: </p>

          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>their mental or physical health</li>
<li>an injury, such as a broken leg </li>
<li>a diagnosed or undiagnosed health concern </li>
<li>a long-term health condition</li>
<li>an impairment or disability  </li>
      </ul>
<p>
After the assessment, you and and your employee will get a report with advice. This can help you understand what support they need to stay in or return to work. This could include:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>advice on any <a href="https://www.gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers"> reasonable adjustments</a> you could make </li>
<li>guidance on free and paid-for changes you could make to support them</li>
<li>links to other organisations who may be able to help </li>
</ul>
