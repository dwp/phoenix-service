Using occupational health to help an employee <h1>


<p>
An employer may have concerns about an employee because:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>there's been a change in how the employee is performing at work</li>
<li>the employee has been off sick more often than normal </li>
<li>the employee is long-term sick (off work sick for more than 4 weeks)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If an employer has concerns, they can ask the employee if they'll agree to an occupational health assessment. 
</p>

<p>The employee does not have to agree to it, but it's a good idea as it can help them:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>get back to work </li>
<li>get any support they might need </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> What happens in an occupational health assessment </h2>

<p>During the assessment, an occupational health adviser will talk to the employee. The adviser could be a doctor, nurse, or other occupational health professional. 
</p>

<p>They will ask the employee about:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>their health and any treatment they're having</li>
<li>their usual work activities</li>
<li>their general lifestyle and activities outside work </li>
</ul>

<p>The conversation is confidential. The adviser will not share anything without the employee's consent.  
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens after the assessment</h2>

<p>The occupational health adviser will send a report to the employee. They will check with the employee if they can show the report to their employer. 
</p>


<p>The report will contain advice and recommendations, which could include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>adjustments to the employee's workspace, such as a bigger screen or ergonomic chair
</li>
<li>a phased return to work or different working hours</li>
<li>a referral to other services, like physiotherapy</li>
</ul>



<p>The employer and employee should then decide the best course of action. </p>
